# DnD5e Weapon Columns

## Description

This module adds the range, the to hit modifier, as well as the damage formula to every weapon in a dnd5e PC sheet. It uses the values calculated by Foundry, so if your formulas use non-standard stats for calculation, this module should still work (as long as foundry calculates it right).
